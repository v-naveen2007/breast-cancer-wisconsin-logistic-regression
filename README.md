steps to do program logistic regression
1. Load dataset  
2. Split into train/test sets  
3. Standardize features  
4. Train Logistic Regression model  
5. Evaluate with confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC-AUC  
6. Tune threshold and visualize sigmoid function  

output:
- Accuracy: ~97%  
- ROC-AUC: ~0.99
